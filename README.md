## Supernova remnant shock evolution

Code adapted from [Tang&Chevalier, 2016](http://arxiv.org/abs/1607.06391) paper providing shock evolution equations (ala Truelove&McKee99).
However the equations provided in TC2016 are simpler and provide a better accuracy in the case of a shock evolution in a stellar 
wind (s=2).
In addition only one set of equations are necessary to cover the ejecta dominated phase and the ambient dominate phase providing
therefore a smooth shock speed profile (the TM equations provide two sets of equations that are connected at a given point in time ; 
creating artificially a spike in the Vsh profile).
